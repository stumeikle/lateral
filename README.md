The general idea is: you define your domain. All code below that can be generated for you.
This includes: persistence entities, caching (distributed and local), repositories, persistence mechanisms,
database schemas. Also REST APIs and versioned pojos. Lateral can generate all this from your domain description.
Sensible choices are used for establishing the ORM. Lateral also includes a plugin framework so you can switch
from local to distributed caches, write-through to write-behind persistence, and so on, with simple configuration changes.
