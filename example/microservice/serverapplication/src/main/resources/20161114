Tired.
Tired of K's lack of support.
Matthew stayed here overnight and it raised some concerns. Hard work. Boy needs a father.
Kirsi needs a father too.

More than ready to leave. 
We're discussing if Kirsi will move into a flat in aberdeen and i can fix up the house.
But today I am uncertain about that option. I've thrown my career away too many times.
I've still got 20 years left working and if I stop now there will be no going back.
I think peak earnings have passed.
Staying here would mean teaching and based on my reactions to matthew i'm not convinced that's something i would enjoy
Worn out from being alone
