What would we need?

Basic data structures.
Maybe some logic around object creation.

A spreadsheet to populate the initial db data.
A means to upload that.
(Does this mean we need a secondary URL with tighter access control? or even another app)
Maybe i could just leverage a database UI for this? -> yes but they all want monies
maybe cassandra cli is even an option

A query to return all the menu-item headers (ie food and drink)
A query to return the next level down
(or something similar, a menu navigator)

At that point we're about ready to take orders.
So then we need a UI to show the menu items and make selections

and we'd want business robustness, docker etc. deploy the ui to the cloud
something. maybe deploy everything to the cloud.

It's quite hard really. there's a lot to do.

Later i'd want to be able to add menu items, change prices, add security
basically change the object schema and easily handle the migration.

There'd definitely be an argument for using spring boot here to leverage all the contents there
but that'll take us away from onion arch and ddd which i think we need to stay with.
